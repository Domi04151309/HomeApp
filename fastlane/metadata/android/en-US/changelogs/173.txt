This update includes new layouts for Hue rooms and lamps. Furthermore, you can now see your scene and lamp colors and if your hue lamps are reachable. Try changing the color of your Hue lamps with the new visual color picker. In addition to that, the experimental device discovery has been made more robust and the Node-RED dashboard can now be viewed in the app. A button for opening websites in your browser has been added as well and reordering your devices is more intuitive with this update. In case you are using Fritz! products, you can try the new Auto-Login mode to save some time. Your passwords are stored encrypted. And finally, lots of invisible performance improvements have been made.
