## How it works
Communication between the devices uses HTTP requests and JSON strings. After the commanding device has send a HTTP request to the smart home device, the smart home device sends back a JSON string containing the information the app needs.

This app is especially useful if you are using microcontrollers or other small devices such as the Raspberry Pi for smart home automation.
